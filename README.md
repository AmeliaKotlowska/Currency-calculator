# Currency-calculator
Implement a currency calculator that can convert the value given in zlotys to the value in euros, US dollars and British pounds. An additional assumption is that the currency calculator downloads the current exchange rate from an external system. When performing this task, take into account both the buying and selling rate. Test your code using Mockito.
